DETOX64 v0.9
==================================================================
This was just a quick hack to batch convert some old C64 BASIC progams,
without having to go by a C64 emulator.  Support for other formats will
be implemented on request.

EXAMPLE USAGE
==================================================================
For processing a standard C64 BASIC file, just type:

        detox64 myfile.bas

If you saved the BASIC file from inside an emulator, for example VICE,
the file extension might be "p00".  In this case, the file has an extended
header which begins with "C64File", and it can be skipped by issuing the
following parameter:

        detox64 -f p00 myfile.p00

The parameter "-f bas" is currently redundant, but is provided for
future use.


TEST FILES
==================================================================
The directory "tests" provides a few sample files for testing detox64.
